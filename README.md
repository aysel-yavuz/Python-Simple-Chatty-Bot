# Simple-Chatty-Bot

So what i have learned at this basic project.

It contists five Stages and their sub-stages like variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

Stage 1/5: Chatty Bot welcomes you
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.

Stage 2/5: Print your name
Introduce yourself to the bot.

Stage 3/5: Guess the age
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.

Stage 4/5: Learning numbers
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!

Stage 5/5: Multiple choice
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
